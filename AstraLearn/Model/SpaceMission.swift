                 Gemini 9A, launched on June 3, 1966, aimed to test rendezvous and docking techniques and conduct two extra-vehicular activities (EVAs). The mission faced initial challenges when the original docking target vehicle failed to achieve orbit.
                 
                 Despite a failed docking attempt due to a protective shroud not fully detaching, astronaut Gene Cernan performed a two-hour EVA, demonstrating the difficulty of maneuvering outside the spacecraft. The mission provided crucial data that helped shape future EVA suits and procedures.

                 Apollo 10 served as the final "dress rehearsal" for the moon landing, launched on May 18, 1969. It was designed to test all procedures and components before the actual Moon landing without making the final descent.
                 
                 The crew took the Lunar Module to within 8.4 nautical miles of the lunar surface, testing its systems in lunar orbit. This mission confirmed the performance of the Lunar Module and set the stage for the historic Apollo 11 landing.

                 Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin spent 21 hours on the lunar surface, collecting samples and deploying scientific experiments. Their successful return marked a major triumph in human space exploration.

                 The crew, along with mission control, ingeniously modified the Lunar Module into a 'lifeboat' to survive the journey around the Moon and back to Earth. This mission is now celebrated as a "successful failure" due to the safe return of its crew.
